1. Let's revisit our problem of integrating the orbit of Earth around the Sun.

   a. Have the program write the solution out to a file instead of the screen

   b. Let's change the integration method

   c. Add a function to compute the error in the solution

   d. Now add the ability to integrate a second planet.  Neglect the
      gravity of the planets, and compute their orbits only based on the
      gravitational attraction to the Sun.

      You will need to expand OrbitState to hold the position and
      velocity of both planets.
